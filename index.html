<h2>Web</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="WEB">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web,
is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified
by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
and are published by a software application called a web server.
The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades
and upon which technologies the Web is built.</p>
